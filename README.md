## Compile

Compilation is done with `make` and can be done in different ways.

To creates a dynamically linked binary (advisable)
```
make
```

in case of need of statically linked binary
```
make static
```


When compiled with MSA support junctions is able to internally convert MSA 
files in RC-MSA format to ED-Strings however this is only supported on newer 
intel processors.

To compile a dynamically linked binary
```
make WITH_MSA=true
```

or for a statically linked binary
```
make static WITH_MSA=true
```
